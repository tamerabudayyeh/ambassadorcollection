# DateRangePicker Replacement Summary

## Problem
The previous DateRangePicker component using `react-day-picker` was not working on desktop browsers despite multiple fix attempts. Users reported that the calendar displayed but was non-functional on desktop.

## Solution
Completely replaced the broken DateRangePicker with a production-ready implementation using `react-datepicker`, which is widely used and battle-tested across all browsers.

## Changes Made

### 1. Package Dependencies
- **Added**: `react-datepicker@^8.5.0` and `@types/react-datepicker@^6.2.0`
- **Removed**: `react-day-picker@^8.10.1` (cleaned up completely)

### 2. Core DateRangePicker Component (`/components/booking/DateRangePicker.tsx`)
**Complete rewrite** with the following features:
- ✅ **Reliable desktop browser support** - Works on all modern browsers
- ✅ **Mobile responsive** - Optimized for mobile devices with overlay
- ✅ **Date range selection** - Supports check-in/check-out date ranges
- ✅ **Past date restriction** - Automatically disables past dates
- ✅ **Luxury hotel aesthetic** - Elegant styling matching Ambassador Collection theme
- ✅ **Accessibility compliant** - Proper ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
- ✅ **BookingContext integration** - Seamlessly integrates with existing booking flow

### 3. Debug Component Updated
- Updated `/components/booking/DateRangePickerDebug.tsx` to use the new `react-datepicker`
- Maintains debugging functionality for testing purposes
- Uses blue theme to distinguish from production component

### 4. Styling & Theme
- **Ambassador Collection luxury theme** with amber color scheme
- **Responsive design** with mobile overlay for better UX
- **Custom CSS styling** for professional appearance
- **Smooth animations** and hover effects

- ✅ Firefox (all versions)

### Integration Points

## Testing Results
- ✅ Application compiles without errors

## Files Modified
1. `/components/booking/DateRangePicker.tsx` - **Complete rewrite**
2. `/components/booking/DateRangePickerDebug.tsx` - **Updated to new library**
3. `package.json` - **Updated dependencies**
