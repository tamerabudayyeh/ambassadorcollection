# Mock Payment System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation provides a comprehensive mock payment system for development and testing purposes, removing dependency on real Stripe API keys while maintaining a professional user experience.

## Components Implemented

### 1. MockPaymentForm Component
**File:** `/components/booking/MockPaymentForm.tsx`

**Features:**
- Realistic credit card form with validation
- Card type detection (Visa, Mastercard, Amex)
- Test card numbers for different scenarios
- Professional UI matching the original design
- Mobile-responsive layout
- Security indicators and trust badges
- Development mode notice with test instructions

**Test Card Numbers:**
- Success: `4242 4242 4242 4242`
- Declined: `4000 0000 0000 0002`
- Insufficient Funds: `4000 0000 0000 9995`
- Expired Card: `4000 0000 0000 0069`
- Processing Error: `4000 0000 0000 0119`

### 2. Mock Payment API
**File:** `/app/api/payments/mock/confirm/route.ts`

**Features:**
- Processes mock payment confirmations
- Creates payment records in database
- Updates booking status to confirmed
- Handles different payment scenarios
- Proper error handling and validation

### 3. Enhanced Email Service
**File:** `/lib/email/email-service.ts`

**Enhancements:**
- Mock email sending with console logging
- Fallback email templates for development
- Professional email templates for booking confirmations
- Clear logging with email preview in console
- Easy integration point for real email providers

### 4. Updated Payment Page
**File:** `/app/booking/payment/page.tsx`

**Changes:**
- Removed Stripe dependencies
- Uses MockPaymentForm instead of Stripe PaymentForm
- No more Stripe configuration errors
- Clean, error-free experience

### 5. Enhanced Booking API
**File:** `/app/api/booking/create/route.ts`

**Enhancements:**
- Support for both old and new data formats
- Better error handling
- Proper booking creation and status management
- Compatible with mock payment flow

### 6. Updated Confirmation Page
**File:** `/app/booking/confirmation/page.tsx`

**Enhancements:**
- Reads booking details from sessionStorage for mock flow
- Fetches booking details from API when available
- Fallback to context-based flow for compatibility
- Enhanced email sending with proper booking data
- Loading states and error handling

## User Experience Flow

### 1. Booking Process
1. User selects hotel, room, and dates
2. User enters guest information
3. User proceeds to payment page
4. MockPaymentForm displays with development notice
5. User can use test card numbers or any valid-format card
6. Payment processing simulation (2-second delay)
7. Success/failure handling based on card number

### 2. Success Flow
1. Booking created in database
2. Payment record created with "succeeded" status
3. Booking status updated to "confirmed"
4. Confirmation email sent (logged to console)
5. User redirected to confirmation page
6. Confirmation page displays booking details

### 3. Error Handling
- Invalid card numbers show appropriate error messages
- Network errors are handled gracefully
- User can retry failed payments
- Clear error messages guide users

## Development Benefits

### 1. No External Dependencies
- No need for Stripe API keys
- No external service configuration
- Works completely offline
- Fast development and testing

### 2. Realistic Experience
- Professional payment interface
- Complete booking flow
- Email confirmations
- Database integration
- Proper status management

### 3. Easy Testing
- Multiple test scenarios available
- Predictable behavior
- Console logging for debugging
- Database records created

### 4. Migration Ready
- Same API structure as real implementation
- Easy to swap MockPaymentForm for real Stripe form
- Database schema compatible
- Email service ready for real providers

## Console Output Example

When a payment is processed, you'll see detailed logs:

```
âœ… Mock payment processed successfully: {
  bookingId: 'uuid-here',
  paymentId: 'mock_payment_1642345678901',
  amount: 150,
  currency: 'USD',
  cardLast4: '4242'
}

ðŸ“§ ============= MOCK EMAIL SENT =============
ðŸ“§ To: guest@example.com
ðŸ“§ From: Ambassador Collection <reservations@ambassadorcollection.com>
ðŸ“§ Subject: Booking Confirmation - AMB123ABC
ðŸ“§ HTML Content Preview:
<html><body>...booking details...</body></html>
ðŸ“§ =========================================
```

## Production Migration

To migrate to real Stripe payments:

1. **Replace MockPaymentForm:**
   ```typescript
   // In /app/booking/payment/page.tsx
   import PaymentForm from '@/components/booking/PaymentForm'; // Real Stripe form
   // Instead of MockPaymentForm
   ```

2. **Configure Stripe:**
   - Add real Stripe API keys to environment variables
   - Update `/lib/stripe/payment-service.ts` with real implementation

3. **Update API Endpoints:**
   - Replace mock confirm endpoint with real Stripe webhook
   - Update payment creation logic

4. **Email Service:**
   - Configure real email provider (Resend, SendGrid, etc.)
   - Update email service configuration

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files:
- `/components/booking/MockPaymentForm.tsx`
- `/app/api/payments/mock/confirm/route.ts`

### Modified Files:
- `/app/booking/payment/page.tsx`
- `/app/booking/confirmation/page.tsx`
- `/app/api/booking/create/route.ts`
